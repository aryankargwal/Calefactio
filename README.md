# CalefactioðŸ”¥
We plan to create an Exploratory Data Analytics Web Application that will help us explore and perform operations on the various elements effecting global warming.
## ObjectiveðŸ¤”
Having a comprehensive view of various factors effecting the climate with the ability of performing operations will be really helpful. With our clean UI and nifty features like uploading your own database, the application is sure to be helpful.
## Dataset UsedðŸ“š
For the intial working and reference of data field we are using the [GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4)](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/) dataset by NASA.<br>
The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis ver. 4 (GISTEMP v4) is an estimate of global surface temperature change. Graphs and tables are updated around the middle of every month using current data files from NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations) and ERSST v5 (ocean areas), combined as described in our publications Hansen et al. (2010) and Lenssen et al. (2019). These updated files incorporate reports for the previous month and also late reports and corrections for earlier months.
